== Glossary

YAML uses a number of specific terms to describe its structure, syntax and the
data it represents. Many of these terms have different synonyms in specific
programming languages. Reading through this glossary is an excellent way to
get a quick overview of YAML.

[glossary]
Alias::
        A reference to another _node_ in a YAML _document_.
        Syntactically this is written with an asterisk followed by an
        identifier. Like this: `*foo`. Every alias in a document must be
        preceded by an _anchor_ with the same identifier.

Anchor::
        A name given to a specific node. Syntactically this written with
        an ampersand followed by an identifier. Like this: `&foo`. Nodes
        that are named with anchors, may be referenced later in a
        _document_ by an _alias_ node.

Block::
        A syntactic style of a _collection_ that uses indentation to
        indicate structure and scope.

Collection::
        A _node_ that can contain zero or more pieces of data, as
        opposed to a _scalar_ which is exactly one data point.
        _Mappings_ and _sequences_ are YAML collections.

Directive::
        A part of a YAML _stream_ that is used to define meta properties
        of the serialization, and is not part of the serialization
        itself. Directives are lines that begin with a percent sign,
        followed by a keyword. Directives apply to the _document_ that
        follows them. '%YAML' and '%TAG' are the only two directives
        currently.

Document::
        The YAML serialization of a complete graph. A document can
        represent a _collection_ or a single _scalar_.

Explicit Typing::
        Every YAML _node_ has a type. Nodes that are preceded by a _tag_
        are explicitly typed.

Flow::
        A syntactic style of a _collection_ that uses braces to indicate
        structure and scope. It is very similar to the JSON format.

Implicit Typing::
        Every YAML _node_ has a type. Nodes that are _not_ preceded by a
        _tag_ are implicitly typed.

Mapping::
        A _collection_ of zero or more _key_ / _value_ pairs. A
        mapping is the YAML equivalent to a _hash_ in Perl, a
        _dictionary_ in Python, or an _object_ in JavaScript. It is
        also sometimes called an _associative array_. Two important
        properties of a _mapping_ are that keys are unique, and that
        the pairs are not ordered.

Node::
         A single, addressable, data point. A _vertice_ on a
         _directional cyclic graph_. A node may be either a
         _collection_, a _scalar_ or an _alias_.

Scalar::
        A _node_ that contains a single value, like a string or a number.

Sequence::
        An ordered _collection_ of zero or more single _nodes_. A
        sequence is the YAML equivalent to an _array_ in Perl or a
        _list_ in Python.

Stream::
        Zero or more YAML _documents_. A stream is the entire sequence
        of contiguous characters. For example, an entire YAML file on
        disk is considered to be a YAML stream.

Tag::
        A string that indicates the type of a given _node_. A tag is
        written with an exclamation point followed by a tag string.
        Examples are '!!int' and !object:Foo'.
