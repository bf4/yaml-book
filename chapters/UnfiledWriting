=== Dive Into YAML

Let's take a look at some actual data in these 3 formats. First we'll look at
a sample snippet of XML that I found on the Wikipedia entry about XML.

[[question_answer_xml]]

<?xml version="1.0">
<quiz>
  <question>
  Who was the forty-second
  president of the U.S.A.?
  </question>
  <answer>
  William Jefferson Clinton
  </answer>
<!-- Note: We need to add
   more questions later. -->
</quiz>

[[question_answer_json]]

{
"quiz": [
  {
    "question": "Who was the forty-second president of the U.S.A.?",
    "answer": "William Jefferson Clinton"
  }
]
}
</quiz>

[[question_answer_yaml]]

%YAML: 1.2
