    <!-- Reference new files using XIncludes (not entities): http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/ModularDoc.html#UsingXinclude 

         Each file should have a DOCTYPE at the top of it so you can validate it alone (just like this but with a chapter/preface instead of book

         Remember, using XIncludes means that you'll have to add a flag (typically 'xinclude' with one or two dashes) when using XML processors/parsers 
  
         Validate with xmllint as follows  (Basic setup same as libxslt: http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/InstallingAProcessor.html)
         Note: replace __ below with two dashes (we can't put the latter in a comment without invalidating the file) 

	    $ xmllint __xinclude __noout __postvalid book.xml
